#
Wii "Forecast Channel" themed website using basic Open Weather Map API // first public github repo

## Website Link

https://effyisoffline.github.io/weather-site/



## Note

This is my first public GitHub project :3 If there's anything I could do differently I'd love to see it. There's an issue with the Open Weather Map API where you can only type in the city... not the country or state name.
